This program developed, piloted, launched, and evaluated a broad range of projects supporting national and local HIV prevention and control programs; evidence-based decision-making; strengthening systems and capacity at national, provincial, and local levels; prioritizing high-risk geographic areas and populations; developing innovative approaches for scale-up; answering important scientific questions that can be most effectively answered in China but also with global implications for the HIV response; and increasing China\u2019s engagement with the global public health community and sharing critical lessons learned. A productive working relationship with well-conceived models, a results-based activity implementation plan, and proper linkage to the domestic policy process has made a significant contribution to HIV control and prevention in China. Within the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one can find Planning and Strategy. ; China\u2019s response to a novel coronavirus stands in stark contrast to the 2002 SARS outbreak response // The strengthening of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has been a turning point in outbreak responses in the area. This represents very welcome progress and development for global health security and diplomacy. The Planning and Strategy division is included within the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ;  Infectious Diseases Prevention and Control // China is a big country with huge regional differences in social economic development. The large population, high population density and mobility, as well as significant regional differences in life style make infectious diseases a major threat to China. With strong outburst and fast spread, infectious diseases are also more difficult to control in China. So China has to stick to a strategy which emphasizes both prevention and therapy in infectious disease control.
